%//fscanf OR xlsread?? Dependign on extension, possible menu opportunity
%^^^COMPLETED 4/10/2016^^^

%Create menu ("choice = menu(...)") with each choice being one of the
%statistical analysis.

%"Switch(choice)", each case runs different function (just the old
%functions from past assignments?). Make sure the variables/arrays that
%contain final output are easily traceable and can be called.

%"Congratulations, your analysis is completed. What would you like to name
%the output file? (Please include extension as well)(be careful to not
%choose the name of a file that already exits!!"
%//menu for type (.xlsx, .txt, .mat)??
